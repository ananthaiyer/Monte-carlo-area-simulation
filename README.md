# Monte-carlo-area-simulation
Use Monte Carlo integration with uniformly distributed random variables to approximate a function for b=6 and b= infinity, and compare results with analytical integration.
Analyze the accuracy of Monte Carlo results, especially the discrepancy between b=6 and b=infinity, and provide reasoning.
Estimate the area enclosed by a polar function r(t) using Monte Carlo simulations, visualizing the function and calculating the area for different sample sizes.
Summarize results in tables and graphs, and explain the effectiveness of Monte Carlo simulations in solving such problems.
